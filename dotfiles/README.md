There are many other great software tools that we do not have time to discuss this semester.
This folder contains configuration files for a few such tools, just in case anyone is curious.

# Vim
Following the instructions at http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/

This semester we will focus on the Anaconda Python 3.6 distribution and the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). 
These are required course materials and I will not troubleshoot the installation and use of any other tools, IDEs, and distributions. 

The only exception to the above is [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), which we will use later in the semester.
Currently, JupyterLab is in [early beta stage](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestones) and I want to give the project more time to develop before we implement it in our class.

If you are curious about the following tools:
- atom text editor
- conda package and environment manager
- classic jupyter notebooks
please look at the [config folder in the GitHub repo from last semester](https://github.com/marskar/BIOF309_Fall2017/tree/master/config).
